INFO-CALLBACK has to be a function of two arguments which will be
bound to THIS and INFO. When called, INFO-CALLBACK should return
a modified version of the INFO argument in which no information
is missing.
When non-nil, PROGRESS-CALLBACK has to be a function that may be
called repeatedly while the connection is established.

Implementations can rely on the fact that the property :session
in INFO contains the `rudel-session' object to which the new
connection will be associated.")
