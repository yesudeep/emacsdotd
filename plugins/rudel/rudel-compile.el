;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains some Emacs Lisp code, which can be used to
;; generate autoloads for Rudel and byte-compile Rudel. Autoloads or
;; written into a file named rudel-loaddefs.el. This file should be
;; loaded during the Emacs startup process.
;;
;; Press M-x eval-buffer to generate autoloads and byte-compile Rudel.


;;; History:

  ;; subdirectories on the load path.

  ;; Byte compile everything.

  ;; (auto)loaded.
